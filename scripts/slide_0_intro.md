### SPEAKER NOTES / NARRATION SCRIPT

*(Dramatic opening — pause for 2 seconds before speaking)*

What if the algorithm that was supposed to help you discover new music... was actually keeping you trapped?

*(Beat)*

Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. My name is **Vishesh Prajapati**, and today I'm going to take you inside one of the most critical product challenges facing the world's largest music streaming platform — **Spotify**.

*(Pause — let that land)*

Let me start with a question. Think about the last time Spotify genuinely surprised you. Not a song you already knew. Not an artist you'd heard of. A genuine moment of musical discovery — where you pressed play on something unfamiliar, and it stopped you in your tracks.

If you're struggling to remember... you're not alone.

**713 million people** use Spotify every month. That's nearly one in every ten humans on Earth. It is, by every measure, the dominant force in music streaming — commanding a **31.7% global market share**, nearly double its closest competitor.

But beneath those headline numbers lies a growing crisis — one that threatens the very foundation of what made Spotify revolutionary in the first place.

**100 million power users** — Spotify's most loyal, most valuable customers — are experiencing what we've termed **"Discovery Fatigue."** The algorithm that once felt magical? It now feels like a cage. Users aren't discovering new music anymore. They're being fed the same artists, the same sounds, the same safe recommendations — over and over again.

Discover Weekly engagement has **dropped 18% year-over-year**. Skip rates on algorithmic playlists are **up 23%**. And on community forums and social media, over **50,000 posts** use the hashtag #SpotifyBubble to express a single, unified frustration:

*"Spotify used to help me explore. Now it just echoes."*

*(Pause)*

Today, I'm going to walk you through:

1. **The Problem** — How we identified and quantified the Discovery Echo Chamber
2. **The Root Causes** — The five interconnected reasons why Spotify's discovery engine broke
3. **The Solution** — A three-pronged product strategy: the Discovery Dial, Exploration Mode, and Discovery Stats
4. **The Implementation** — A disciplined 20-week rollout from MVP to global launch
5. **The Business Impact** — A projected **$1.33 billion** in annual revenue impact
6. **The User Impact** — Real stories of transformation across three distinct user personas
7. **The Learnings** — What worked, what surprised us, and where we go next

This isn't just a case study about fixing an algorithm. It's a case study about **giving users back control of their own musical journey** — and in doing so, strengthening Spotify's competitive moat, reducing churn, and unlocking over a billion dollars in value.

*(Transition)*

Let's begin.
