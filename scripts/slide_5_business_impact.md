### SPEAKER NOTES / NARRATION SCRIPT

Let's talk money. Because at the end of the day, a product initiative needs to justify itself in business terms. And the numbers here are extraordinary.

**Revenue Impact: Three Revenue Streams**

Our projected annual impact totals approximately $1.33 billion across three distinct revenue streams.

**Stream 1: Churn Reduction — $840 Million Preserved**

This is the biggest number, and it's the most defensible. Here's the math:

Spotify has 281 million Premium subscribers, each paying an average of $120 per year. Our current monthly churn rate is 4.1%. We're projecting a 2.5% reduction in that churn rate — bringing it down to about 3.6% over 12 months.

Why is this realistic? Because discovery fatigue is a leading indicator of churn. When users feel like the algorithm has stopped working for them — when Discover Weekly becomes "Discover the Same Thing Weekly" — they start considering alternatives. Apple Music, YouTube Music, even just going back to their own downloaded library.

By giving users the Discovery Dial and reigniting that sense of musical surprise, we're addressing the emotional trigger that precedes cancellation. A 2.5% reduction in churn across 281 million subscribers at $120 per year preserves approximately $840 million in annual revenue that would otherwise walk out the door.

**Stream 2: Premium Conversion — $311 Million in New Revenue**

Spotify has approximately 432 million free-tier users. The current conversion rate from free to Premium is 6.2%. We're projecting a 0.6 percentage point increase to 6.8%.

Why? Because improved discovery is one of the most compelling reasons to upgrade. When Priya — our 19-year-old college student persona — starts getting genuinely exciting recommendations through Exploration Mode and sees her Discovery Stats, the value proposition of Premium becomes tangible. Ad-free discovery, offline access to new finds, unlimited skips while exploring — these benefits crystallize when discovery actually works.

A 0.6% conversion improvement across 432 million free users at $120 per year generates approximately $311 million in new annual revenue.

**Stream 3: Increased Ad Revenue — $180 Million Incremental**

Even for users who stay on the free tier, better discovery means longer sessions. We're projecting an average of 8 additional minutes per session for free-tier users.

Longer sessions mean more ad inventory. More diverse listening means better taste profiling for ad targeting. Better targeting means higher CPMs — cost per thousand impressions — which means more revenue per ad slot.

We project approximately $180 million in incremental annual ad revenue from these combined effects.

**Strategic Alignment**

This isn't just a revenue play. It aligns with every one of Spotify's stated strategic pillars:

"Audio First" Platform — This enhances the core music experience, which is Spotify's foundational product. Before podcasts, before audiobooks, before video — music discovery is why Spotify exists.

Creator Economy — The Discovery Dial and Exploration Mode surface emerging artists. When underground musicians see that Spotify is the platform where new listeners find them, more artists are attracted to the platform. This enriches the catalog, which improves the experience for everyone.

Global Expansion — Exploration Mode's "World Sounds" journey drives cross-market listening. When a user in Berlin discovers a cumbia artist from Colombia through a Discovery Journey, that's global expansion in action — not through marketing spend, but through product experience.

Premium Growth — Improved discovery is perhaps the most compelling Premium value proposition we can offer. Users don't upgrade for features they can't feel. Discovery you can *control* — that's something you can feel.

Competitive Differentiation — User-controlled discovery is an industry first. No competitor offers it. This creates a defensible moat that's difficult to replicate because it requires both the ML infrastructure and the editorial ecosystem we're building.

**Projected Metric Improvements**

Let me walk through the key business metrics we expect to move:

DAU/MAU ratio — currently at 42%. We're targeting 44% at 6 months and 46% at 12 months. This means more users are coming back daily, not just monthly. Discovery gives them a reason to check in.

Average session length — currently 26 minutes. Targeting 28 minutes at 6 months, 31 minutes at 12 months. Five additional minutes per session across hundreds of millions of users is massive.

Discover Weekly weekly active users — currently 85 million. Targeting 100 million at 6 months and 115 million at 12 months. That's a 35% increase in the flagship discovery product's user base.

Artist discovery rate — currently 2.1 new artists per user per week. Targeting 3.0 at 6 months and 4.2 at 12 months. We want to double the rate at which users find new artists they love.

And Premium monthly churn — from 4.1% down to 3.8% at 6 months and 3.6% at 12 months.

**The Monetization Flywheel**

Here's the beautiful thing about this solution: it creates a flywheel.

Better discovery leads to happier users. Happier users stay longer and upgrade more. More Premium subscribers mean more revenue. More revenue means more investment in editorial curation and ML improvements. Better curation and ML mean even better discovery. And the cycle reinforces itself.

Meanwhile, emerging artists see Spotify as the platform where they get discovered. More artists means a richer catalog. A richer catalog means better discovery possibilities. Another reinforcing loop.

This isn't a one-time revenue bump. It's a structural improvement to Spotify's growth engine.
