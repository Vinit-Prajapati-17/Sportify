### SPEAKER NOTES / NARRATION SCRIPT

Welcome to our deep-dive case study on one of the most critical product challenges facing Spotify in 2026: the Discovery Echo Chamber.

Let's set the stage with some staggering numbers. Spotify has 713 million monthly active users as of Q3 2025 — that's roughly one in every ten people on the planet. Of those, 281 million are paying Premium subscribers, and Spotify commands a 31.7% global market share, nearly double Apple Music at 15%.

But beneath these impressive numbers lies a growing crisis.

Approximately 250 million of Spotify's users are what we call "power users" — people who listen 60 or more minutes a day and have been on the platform for over 2 years. These are Spotify's most valuable customers. And about 40% of them — roughly 100 million people — are experiencing what we've termed "Discovery Fatigue."

What does Discovery Fatigue look like in the data?

First, Discover Weekly engagement — measured by saves and likes — has declined approximately 18% year over year. That's Spotify's flagship discovery product losing nearly one-fifth of its effectiveness.

Second, skip rates on algorithmic playlists have increased by 23%. Users are literally pressing "next" more than ever.

Third, on community forums like community.spotify.com, we found over 10,000 threads mentioning words like "repetitive," "stale," or "echo chamber." On social media, the hashtag #SpotifyBubble trended on Twitter/X and Reddit with over 50,000 posts in just six months.

And the NPS — Net Promoter Score — among power users has dropped 6 points year-over-year. Recommendation quality, rated by power users, fell from 3.9 out of 5 in 2023 to just 3.1 today.

To put human faces on this data, let me introduce three user personas:

Maya is a 24-year-old marketing professional who listens 90 minutes a day. She loves genre-hopping — indie rock to Afrobeats to lo-fi hip-hop. But her Discover Weekly is locked on indie rock. She says: "My Discover Weekly has been the same vibe for 6 months. I miss being surprised."

James is a 31-year-old software engineer and amateur DJ with over 2,000 saved songs. He's been on Spotify for 6 years. He says: "I feel like Spotify only shows me what I already listen to. Where's the discovery?"

And Priya is a 19-year-old college student on the free tier. Her biggest frustration? AI-generated filler tracks infiltrating her playlists. She says: "Half the songs in my Release Radar are from AI music farms, not real artists. I can't trust it anymore."

The message from all three is clear: Spotify's algorithm, once celebrated as "magical," is now creating a cage.
