### SPEAKER NOTES / NARRATION SCRIPT

We've diagnosed the problem. We understand the root causes. Now let's talk about the fix.

Our proposed solution has three interconnected components, each targeting a different dimension of the discovery problem. Together, they form a cohesive experience that gives users something no streaming platform has ever offered: direct control over their own music discovery.

**Feature 1: The Discovery Dial**

Imagine a slider — simple, elegant, intuitive — sitting right at the top of your Discover Weekly playlist. It goes from 0 to 100.

At 0, you're in the "Comfort Zone." That's the current Spotify experience — familiar artists, safe picks, the algorithm playing it safe.

At 25, it's "Mostly Familiar" — a few new surprises sprinkled in.

At 50, "Balanced" — half familiar, half new.

At 75, "Push My Boundaries" — the algorithm actively seeks out artists and genres you haven't explored.

And at 100, "Maximum Novelty" — cross-genre, international, emerging artists, zero repeats from the last 90 days. This is for the adventurous listener who wants to be genuinely surprised.

Here's what makes it powerful: the default is set to 30 for existing users — minimal disruption. For new users, it starts at 50. It persists per playlist, so your Discover Weekly can be adventurous while your Daily Mix stays comfortable. And it updates in real-time — within 60 seconds of adjusting, you get a fresh playlist.

This is available on Discover Weekly, Release Radar, Daily Mixes, and radio stations. Every algorithmic surface becomes tuneable.

**Feature 2: Exploration Mode**

This is a dedicated card in your Home feed: "Explore Something New."

Think of it as curated Discovery Journeys — themed collections that blend algorithmic signals with human editorial expertise. We've designed five launch journeys:

"World Sounds" — global music from underrepresented regions. Malian blues, Japanese city pop, Colombian cumbia. Music you'd never find on your own.

"Underground Rising" — pre-viral artists with under 10,000 monthly listeners. The next big thing, before it's the next big thing.

"Genre Mashups" — cross-genre fusions like jazz-hop, folk-tronica, Latin metal. For listeners who don't fit in boxes.

"Time Capsule" — deep cuts from past decades. 70s soul rarities, 90s shoegaze B-sides. Musical archaeology.

And "Community Picks" — crowd-sourced from Spotify's most active curators. Real users sharing real hidden gems, validated by our editorial team.

These rotate weekly. They're shareable. And critically — AI-generated content is explicitly filtered and labeled. Human-created music is always prioritized.

**Feature 3: Discovery Stats**

This is the gamification layer that makes discovery sticky. Every month, you get a "Discovery Report" in your profile — think Spotify Wrapped, but for your exploration habits.

It shows you: how many new artists you discovered, a visual genre map showing how your musical breadth is expanding, a Listening Breadth Score from 0 to 100, and a Discovery Streak — how many consecutive weeks you've listened to 5 or more new artists.

And then there are badges. "Genre Explorer" for listening to 5 new genres this month. "Trailblazer" for discovering 20 new artists. "World Traveler" for streaming music from 10 countries. "Early Adopter" for listening to an artist before they hit 50K monthly listeners.

All of these are shareable on social media with branded Spotify graphics. This turns discovery into a social currency.

**Why This Solution Over the Alternatives?**

We considered five alternatives and rejected each:

A complete algorithm overhaul — too risky, 6 to 12 month timeline, could break the experience for 700 million users.

A Tinder-style swipe discovery — tested poorly in 2024 user research. Too casual, too detached from playlist context.

Removing all AI music — impractical. Difficult to detect all AI content, and some AI music is legitimate.

Copying Apple Music's editorial model — doesn't scale to 713 million users. Too labor-intensive. Removes our personalization advantage.

Social-only discovery through friends' music — limited reach, privacy concerns, doesn't address the core algorithm problem.

Our solution wins because it gives users agency without breaking existing behavior. It's technically feasible as an overlay on the existing recommendation engine — no core rebuild needed. It combines algorithmic personalization with human curation. It creates a unique competitive moat — no competitor offers adjustable discovery controls. And Discovery Stats generates shareable content that drives organic marketing.

**Prioritization: RICE Scoring**

Using Reach times Impact times Confidence divided by Effort:

Discovery Dial scores 300 — that's our P0, our highest priority. It reaches 250 million users with high impact and 80% confidence, and it's a moderate effort level of 2.

Exploration Mode scores 93 — P1 priority. 200 million reach, moderate impact, 70% confidence, higher effort at 3.

Discovery Stats scores 90 — also P1. 150 million reach, moderate impact, 60% confidence, moderate effort.

The Dial ships first. Then Exploration Mode. Then Stats. Each builds on the last.
